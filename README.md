This project is just a small step on my road of learning React.

## What did I learn from this porject?

### `Using react-router-dom`

In a previous project I was stuck at changing the main page content when clicking a link to load a specific component, so I wrote some code to overcome the situation. Even if I was proud of my self for creating a solution for the problem, it has nothing to do with the fact of it was a shitty hard coded snippet.<br/>
Few other days passed, I finished working on that project and returned to learning new stuff again. I read about client side routing so I decided to take a toturial on that. And learned how to use React Router, and man I was happy xD.<br/>
The most important lesson here is: If you are stuck on somthing, It's good to creat a work around for it, but for the time sake usually there is some one had made it better
